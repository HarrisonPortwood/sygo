# Sygo
A tool designed to help freelancers and hourly workers keep track of the time they have worked.
#### How is it different?
Sygo was designed with the user in mind. It is simple, looks great and is lightweight. Time is captured from your computer, so you don't have to worry about other programs lagging the application. The time will always be accurate.
